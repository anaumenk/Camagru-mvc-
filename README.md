# Camagru

This web project is a small web application allowing user to make basic photo using webcam and some predefined images.

Users are be able to select an image from a list of superposable images,
take a picture with webcam and admire the result that should be mixing of both pictures.

All captured images are public, likeables and commentable.

This version of Camagru is a recreation of older one using MVC pattern and oppotunity
to drag and grop superposable images and put them in any place on the image.
